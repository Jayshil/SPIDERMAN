``spiderman`` would not have happened without the following people:

- Laura Kreidberg was responsible for the early concept and much of the inspiration of this project.
- Xi Zhang for sharing his analytical solution to temperature distribution on a Hot Jupiter.
- The majority of this code was written during the `Kavli Summer Program in Astrophysics 2016 <https://kspa.soe.ucsc.edu/program>`_, my thanks to the organisers and participants for a stimulating work environment.
