Installation
============
pip
---
The fastest way to get the latest stable version of ``spiderman`` up and running is through pip:

::

	$ pip install spiderman-package

From source
-----------
To get the most up to date version of spider install directly from source, though stability is not guarenteed. The `development version <https://github.com/tomlouden/spiderman>`_ can be found on GitHub.

Installing from GitHub is straightforward, simply type
::

   $ git clone https://github.com/tomlouden/SPIDERMAN
To 'clone' the repository, then install using the setup script:
::

   $ sudo python setup.py install

And that's it!
(Note that you'll need to ``cd`` out of the source directory **before** you can import ``spiderman``.)


Tests
-----
An Ipython notebook is included with a few examples, I recommend running it to test everything is working correctly. (built in test functions coming soon)
